== Frequently Asked Questions ==
1. Does WP Demo Budddy work for ANY plugin/theme?
Yes. With any plugin/theme that is coded in WordPress prescribed standards.

2.Is my plugin/theme secure?
Absolutely.  All functions in WordPress that provide access the codes are blocked for all user roles.  Also, you can set the role of the Demo user.

3. How to install multiple plugins?
If you want to install more than one plugin on the same demo, unzip all the plugins in a folder and zip the folder.  Then upload this zip file.

4. Why only one theme per demo?
Unlike plugins, only one theme can be active at any time in WordPress.   You can upload multiple plugins like you upload plugins.  Only one theme will be activated. Providing Theme activation permission to the user will compromise security.

5. Will WP Demo Buddy integrate with ANY Autoresponder?
Yes.  Just copy/paste the form code. No API required.  

6.What kind of ads can I display in the user creeated Demo?
In the front end both JS and HTML ADs can be used.  In the admin, only HTML codes will work.  Java Script based AD scripts do not work behind authenticated areas.

7.Can I display Adsense ads?
Not sure.  Please enquire with specific AD networks if this is allowed.
